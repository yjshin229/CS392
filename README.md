## Git Commit convention
1. Make a branch before you start working on your code. <br>
``` git checkout -b <new branch name> ```
   >branch names: <br>
   > ex) feature: p.p calculator, fix: p.p 8.4
2. After you are done with implementing each programming assignment, create a PR to ```dev```.
   > Don't forget to pull from dev before creating a PR!
   > You might also have to fast-forward your current working branch to dev in order to prevent merge conflicts.
  
   > The PR title should be something similar to your branch name. Something that is easy to understand! <br>
  ```feature: implement calculator app 7.4```
   
4. Review the PR.
   > ```dev``` is a protected branch. We need your reviews and approval in order to merge.
   
5. We merge them to ```dev```.
